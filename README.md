Report  

Purpose of the app 

The purpose of the app is to develop a mobile version of the traditional Tamagotchi virtual pet experience. On their Android devices, users may take care of, play with, and clean up after a virtual pet. While providing a visually appealing and customisable experience, the app attempts to replicate the functionality of the original toy. 

 

Design Consideration  

The app will have an eye-catching welcome page to draw players into the game. A warm design, playful animations, and colours that will all work together to create an inviting app. Custom colours schemes and typefaces will be used in the UI to give the app a unique look. This makes it possible to customize and sets the app apart from others that are similar. Depending on what the user does, the pet's picture will change. For example, the pet's image will show the feeding action when the user picks the "feed" button. 

 

Functionality of the app 

Feeding, Playing, and Cleaning: Users can engage in fun tasks with their virtual pet by providing it with food, engaging in play, and providing cleanup after it. Users must often respond to their pet's needs as a result of these acts, which will have an impact on the animal's cleanliness, hunger, and overall health. 

 

Health Monitoring: The app will warn owner of any problems by giving input on the pet's health state. It pushes users to continue using the app and take measures to maintain the wellbeing and health of their pet. 

 

Utilisation of GitHub: 

I'm going to utilize GitHub since it allows us to go back to earlier work and tracks changes made to the codebase, which is crucial to maintaining the features of the app. Because it allows multiple developers to collaborate on a single project and has a bug tracking tool, GitHub is especially helpful for teamwork. 

 

GitHub Action: 

The Tamagotchi app would benefit from GitHub Action since it would automate the build process, which would provide documentation, compile code, and deploy the app to a testing environment.
